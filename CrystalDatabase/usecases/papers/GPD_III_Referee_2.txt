Comments to manuscript Ms.No. pz5072; "Molecular Crystal Global Phase
Diagram III ..." by AJ. B. Keith and R. B. McClurg

The authors address the issue of constructing generic phase diagrams for
certain classes of chemical systems, where certain parameter sets are
derived that allow the characterization of the several possible phases in the
system. They find that a relatively small number is sufficient to do so for
the purpose of their phase diagram construction.
The work appears to have been done correctly, although the presentation is
not necessarily always very clear for the un-initiated. Since such generic
phase diagrams can be quite useful when trying to interpolate between
different "boundary" systems, I think that the work should be of sufficient
general interest to warrant publication once the issues and questions
mentioned below have been addressed.
I also noticed that part II of this sequence of manuscripts is still in the
process of evaluation. The authors and the editor might want to consider to
expand the part-II-manuscript by including some of the work presented in
this part-III-manuscript. They could then move the main body of the part-
III-manuscript reviewed here to a large technical supplementary material,
while including more details for those readers who want to implement the
authors' procedure themselves.

GPD III: this work

First, we apologize reviewer 2 did not get access to GPD II--our intention was to specify that the manuscripts be reviewed together, or at least that the reviewers of GPD III be given a copy of GPD II.  Unfortunately such specifications sometimes are "lost in translation" while transmitting the papers to various staff members.  And yes, originally this work and GPD II were together, but the resulting length of each manuscript (and its supplementary material) was such that a division was absolutely necessary (GPD II and its supplementary material are 63 pages!).  We apologize again for reviewer 2 not having direct access to GPD II.


Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
1. Quite generally, the authors should explain what they mean by "global
phase diagrams", even though this is the third paper in a sequence. Here
they should make the connection to the physics community where generic
phase diagrams have a long-standing tradition. Just consider the many
studies of Ising-models characterized by a small set of interaction
parameters, where generic phase diagrams with critical points etc. are
derived, and where both the general topology of the phase diagram and the
quantitative values of the various critical points are correlated with the
region of parameter space chosen.

Response:
---------
This is a very good point.  We explained this in some detail in GPD I and thoroughly explained and illustrated it with binary  in GPD II, but there is not much of explanation here in GPD III.  We have remedied this by reviewing the discussion from GPD II about GPDs in general.  It discusses binary mixture GPDs originally proposed by Konynenburg and Scott compared to molecular crystal GPDs.  It also augments it with a new discussion aimed more at the physics community, comparing it with these Ising-type models, particularly the Axial Nearest-Neighbor  and particularly withere and also augmenting with a dis

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
2. What about metastable compounds? Can the authors deduce anything in
this regard?

Response:
---------
Yes, that is one of the purposes of GPDs in general.  They allow one to classify polymorphs and help elucidate whether a given structure is metastable or not.  This can be done by examining the vicinity in parameter space of other crystallographic phases. 

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
3. Equation 1: Where is "l" in the formula, and what is its meaning?

Response:
---------
The "l" is a parameter that indexes the spherical harmonics intervening the Wigner functions.  It ranges from |li - lj| to li + lj and is essentially a product of the mathematics--forming a complete basis set over SO3 x S2 x SO3.  As a complete set, these functions have been used extensively in the quantum chemistry literature (see the paper by van der Avoird referenced on page 8), and this has allowed some physical insight into the meaning of "l".  For instance, all electrostatic forces are present in the nu_{li,l,lj} where l = li + lj.  

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
4. Equation 2: If someone wants to follow the authors prescription in
practice, more information is necessary. Please, give a more complete
version of this equation in the appendix including ranges for mi, ni in the
summation.

Response:
---------
   This has been done.  And if reviewer 2 wants to understand this work well enough in order to reproduce it, we would whole-heartedly endorse a thorough reading of GPD I and its supplementary material.  It is an exposition of the thermodynamic procedures and how hard it is to tease a solution out of the mean field equation without having some idea of what phase one is looking for so one can seed the solutions with each possibility.  In quantum mechanics it is more or less known the electrons will be somewhat like their hydrogen equivalents so the numerical seed into the self-consistent mean-field equations of DFT or Hartree-Fock is more or less like hydrogen.  However, in statistical mechanics, the new rotational average could be *anything* -- certain molecules could be ordered (i.e. a non-zero <U_{lmn}> average)...others could be disordered (i.e. <U_{lmn}> = 0 ), and sometimes partially ordered (i.e. some <U_{lmn}>'s = 0 and others not).  Sometimes, some of the molecules in a unit cell are disordered (i.e. spherical) while others are ordered (fixed orientation).  Also, it is unknown how big the new unit cell will be.  In the new figures added to the manuscript, one can see the initial fcc unit cell has expanded to 2, 3, 4, or 32 molecules in a unit cell with a completely new setting.  Fortunately group theory allowed us to look through all the isotropy subgroups of the high temperature reference phase and use these as seeds in the mean field self-consistent equations. 

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
5. Page 10, top: Is the assumption justified that including only pairwise
interactions among nearest neighbors is sufficient?

Response:
---------
This is an assumption which, to a first approximation, is probably adequate for most van der Waals crystals (the majority of molecular crystals).  It would be good to include second-neighbor interactions, particularly when starting from reference lattices which are not a sphere packing as discussed in GPD II.  However, this of course leads to greater computational cost and worse, more axes on the GPD!  Thus we feel the current approach is adequate, but subsequent studies including more rich potentials such as second-neighbor or many-body effects as perturbations on a given direction in nu-space would certainly be interesting.  

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 11: Equation 5: What is A, what is V? (A = free energy at T = 0?, V =
potential energy / total energy?)

Response:
---------
Yes, that is more or less right..."A" is the free energy (at any temperature) and V is the potential energy (since kinetic energy would be 0 at T=0).  Thus the zero point energy is implicitly included in V, etc.  

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 13: First paragraph: There are very many paths between two space
groups (probably infinitely many for a macroscopic system, where one can
play with reducing/adding translational symmetry). Why did the authors
pick the ones they present?

Response:
---------
   Overall scheme: According to previous work (see GPD I), studies show most molecules pack like spheres in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD).  So the idea is to choose sphere packings as translationally-fixed "reference lattices" from which additional symmetry-breaking may occur. On page 13 we demonstrate how this may be done for the subset of tetrahedral molecules in the CSD with an fcc reference lattice (see GPD II for why this reference lattice was chosen for these molecules).
   There were a few surprising results from this exercise.  The first was a discovery of some intriguing phase transition mechanisms for molecules which actually go through a transition from an fcc disordered phase to a lower-temperature ordered phase such as adamantane (225a->114a).  In this transition, the centers of mass of the adamantane molecule apparently stay fixed while the molecules suddenly become rotationally ordered.  Amazingly, this happens through a coupled IR.  Transitions from a coupled IR are thought to be uncommon in the physics community, I believe.  Another discovery was that symmetry breaking pathways may be a useful way to explore packing space, compared to the "brute force" approach commonly used in crystal structure prediction pathways where a molecule is randomly oriented/positioned and operated on by the space group operations of all 230 space groups, then energy-minimized, then compared to each other to remove duplicates (i.e. different domains) and finally sorted to find the lowest-energy phase (this is a simplification--see the literature for a more complete description).  But to get back to the point, space group IR symmetry-breaking removes duplicates by enumerating all possible domains so we only have to calculate the energy of one of them.
   So, to answer the question, the pathways shown in that table and similar ones in the supplementary material are simply a demonstration of the ways to get from the orientationally disordered reference phase to the observed orientationally ordered phase.  In most cases we simply listed the output from ISOTROPY, although in a few cases we had to truncate the results as noted in the supplementary material.  We're not quite sure what reviewer 2 means by reducing/adding symmetry, but if he/she is referring to non group-subgroup phase transitions, we simply didn't consider these (because intuitively, reductions in symmetry from SO3 at certain Wyckoff points should lead to a spacegroup which is a subgroup of the reference lattice).
   
Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 15, top: The restrictions in the allowed ISs appear rather strong - even
if Z' «= 1 for many structures, one should allow for a richer sample space of
structures.

Response:
---------
They are somewhat strong and could be extended to Z' > 1.  Keep in mind this is but a demonstration of approximately how many parameters we need to consider in the constructing GPDs in general.

Page 16, beginning section 2.2.4: I really have a hard time following what
the authors are trying to do here. Please clarify and elaborate. Why do they
minimize atomic distances with respect to fractional coordinates (there
appears to be a comparison between quantities measured in Angstroms and
those which are dimensionless!)?

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 20, second paragraph: Is there a connection to "real" energies of solids
or liquids? If so, how are these energies computed?

Response:
---------
There is a connection and it is all in the nu's, or expansion coefficients of our potential.  As the Wigner, 3jm, and spherical harmonic functions are all unitary, the nus should have good "scaling" properties.  One way to compute the nus, demonstrated in Briels, W. J. (1980). J. Chem. Phys. 73, 1850–1861, is to use the orthogonality of these functions and perform a type of "Fourier transform" on whatever model potential you might want, whether forcefield-based as in the Briels reference or ab initio.

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 21: The authors refer to free energy calculations. I do not see any "free
energies" in their description: everthing seems to be just energy or some
proxy for the energy or a cost function.

Response:
---------
Our apologies again that reviewer 2 was unable to access GPD II.  In that work and especially GPD I, we only deal with the free energy.  This point is summarized on pages 4-5 where we describe how the free energy is minimized in the general method.  To better convey that, we have included two figures from GPD I showing the high temperature reference state as previously mentioned. However, in this paper we look at the low-T solutions so energy is substituted for free energy from Eq. 5 on and that is why it is hard to find.

Reviewer 2's comment:
---------------------
Page 27: I realize that the authors imagine readers reading all their papers
in sequence, but that is not necessarily so. Thus, they should include at
least one generic phase diagram, at least in projection if the number of
parameters needed to describe it is too large. The number of parameters
might appear modest to the authors, but it still appears to be rather large.
How close are we to reality concerning the actual energies?

Response:
---------
An excellent suggestion and an example to illustrate the concept at the beginning of the paper has been included.
