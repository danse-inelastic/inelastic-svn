Comments to manuscript Ms.No. pz5072; "Molecular Crystal Global Phase
Diagram III ..." by AJ. B. Keith and R. B. McClurg

The authors address the issue of constructing generic phase diagrams for
certain classes of chemical systems, where certain parameter sets are
derived that allow the characterization of the several possible phases in the
system. They find that a relatively small number is sufficient to do so for
the purpose of their phase diagram construction.
The work appears to have been done correctly, although the presentation is
not necessarily always very clear for the un-initiated. Since such generic
phase diagrams can be quite useful when trying to interpolate between
different "boundary" systems, I think that the work should be of sufficient
general interest to warrant publication once the issues and questions
mentioned below have been addressed.
I also noticed that part II of this sequence of manuscripts is still in the
process of evaluation. The authors and the editor might want to consider to
expand the part-II-manuscript by including some of the work presented in
this part-III-manuscript. They could then move the main body of the part-
III-manuscript reviewed here to a large technical supplementary material,
while including more details for those readers who want to implement the
authors' procedure themselves.

GPD III: this work

First, we apologize for reviewer 2 not getting access to GPD II--our intention was to specify that the manuscripts be reviewed together, or at least that the reviewers of GPD III be given a copy of GPD II.  Unfortunately such specifications sometimes are "lost in translation" while transmitting the papers to various staff members.  And yes, originally this work and GPD II were together, but the resulting length of each manuscript (and its supplementary material) was such that a division was absolutely necessary (GPD II and its supplementary material are 63 pages).  We apologize again for reviewer 2 not having direct access to GPD II.


1. Quite generally, the authors should explain what they mean by "global
phase diagrams", even though this is the third paper in a sequence. Here
they should make the connection to the physics community where generic
phase diagrams have a long-standing tradition. Just consider the many
studies of Ising-models characterized by a small set of interaction
parameters, where generic phase diagrams with critical points etc. are
derived, and where both the general topology of the phase diagram and the
quantitative values of the various critical points are correlated with the
region of parameter space chosen.

Response:
---------
This is a very good point.  We explained this in some detail in GPD I and thoroughly explained and illustrated it with binary  in GPD II, but there is not much of explanation here in GPD III.  We have remedied this by reviewing the discussion from GPD II about GPDs in general.  It discusses binary mixture GPDs originally proposed by Konynenburg and Scott compared to molecular crystal GPDs.  It also augments it with a new discussion aimed more at the physics community, comparing it with these Ising-type models, particularly the Axial Nearest-Neighbor  and particularly withere and also augmenting with a dis



2. What about metastable compounds? Can the authors deduce anything in
this regard?

Response:
---------
Yes, that is one of the purposes of GPDs in general.  They allow one to classify polymorphs and help elucidate whether a given structure is metastable or not.  This can be done by examining the vicinity in parameter space of other crystallographic phases. 


3. Equation 1: Where is "l" in the formula, and what is its meaning?

Response:
---------
The "l" is a parameter that indexes the spherical harmonics intervening the Wigner functions.  It ranges from |li - lj| to li + lj and is essentially a product of the mathematics--forming a complete basis set over SO3 x S2 x SO3.  As a complete set, these functions have been used extensively in the quantum chemistry literature (see the paper by van der Avoird referenced on page 8), and this has allowed some physical insight into the meaning of "l".  For instance, all electrostatic forces are present in the nu_{li,l,lj} where l = li + lj.  


4. Equation 2: If someone wants to follow the authors prescription in
practice, more information is necessary. Please, give a more complete
version of this equation in the appendix including ranges for mi, ni in the
summation.

Response:
---------
   We completely agree and would wholeheartedly encourage reading GPD I at least.  However, a better explanation would be convenient as well so it has been appendicized as indicated.  
   However, if reviewer 2 wants to understand this work well enough in order to reproduce it, we suggest the following.  First, understand that GPD I contains an exposition of the core concepts such as we also would encourage the reviewer to wait for a much better thermodynamic treatment (to replace the mean field approach of GPD I).


5. Page 10, top: Is the assumption justified that including only pairwise
interactions among nearest neighbors is sufficient?

Response:
---------
This is an assumption which, to a first approximation, is probably adequate for most van der Waals crystals (the majority of molecular crystals).  It would be good to include second-neighbor interactions, particularly when starting from reference lattices which are not a sphere packing as discussed in GPD II.  However, this of course leads to greater computational cost and worse, more axes on the GPD!  Thus we feel the current approach is adequate, but subsequent studies including more rich potentials such as second-neighbor or many-body effects would certainly be interesting.  


Page 11: Equation 5: What is A, what is V? (A = free energy at T = 0?, V =
potential energy / total energy?)

Response:
---------
Yes, that is more or less right..."A" is the free energy (at any temperature) and V is the potential energy (since kinetic energy would be 0 at T=0).  Thus the zero point energy is implicitly included in V, etc.  


Page 13: First paragraph: There are very many paths between two space
groups (probably infinitely many for a macroscopic system, where one can
play with reducing/adding translational symmetry). Why did the authors
pick the ones they present?

Response:
---------
Well, if one supposes that symmetry can be "added" (i.e. molecules suddenly arrange to a *more* symmetrical structure) as well as lost (molecules continue to lose entropy and break their high-symmetry state)


Page 15, top: The restrictions in the allowed ISs appear rather strong - even
if Z' «= 1 for many structures, one should allow for a richer sample space of
structures.

Response:
---------
They are excessively strong and could be extended to Z' > 1


Page 16, beginning section 2.2.4: I really have a hard time following what
the authors are trying to do here. Please clarify and elaborate. Why do they
minimize atomic distances with respect to fractional coordinates (there
appears to be a comparison between quantities measured in Angstroms and
those which are dimensionless!)?

Response:
---------



Page 17, equation 8: What are the units of the various potential
parameters?

Response:
---------



Page 17, right after equation 8: The authors state that MEZDIE01
crystallizes in space group 2. Is that the outcome of their calculations, or is
this used as input to their calculations?

Response:
---------



Page 17, section 2.2.5: Where do the authors get the target structure and its
energy from? What is general, what is specific about the procedure
described in this section? What is really the predictive power of this
method? Please, make a clear list of the information that is used to derive
the parameters, and of the information one can deduce by a strict
application of the authors' rules afterwards.

Response:
---------

seventies.

Page 20, second paragraph: Is there a connection to "real" energies of solids
or liquids? If so, how are these energies computed?

Response:
---------



Page 21: The authors refer to free energy calculations. I do not see any "free
energies" in their description: everthing seems to be just energy or some
proxy for the energy or a cost function.

Response:
---------
Our apologies again for omm


Page 27: I realize that the authors imagine readers reading all their papers
in sequence, but that is not necessarily so. Thus, they should include at
least one generic phase diagram, at least in projection if the number of
parameters needed to describe it is too large. The number of parameters
might appear modest to the authors, but it still appears to be rather large.
How close are we to reality concerning the actual energies?

Response:
---------
Yes, that is more or less right..."A" is the free energy (at any temperature) and V is the potential energy (since kinetic energy would be 0 at T=0).  Thus the zero point energy is implicitely included in V, etc.
