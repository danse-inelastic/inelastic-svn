The ovjour.sty was developed to provide a common
TeX style for all journals of Oldenbourg Wissen-
schaftsverlag.

The main focus is a homogeneous and comfortable
markup of the meta data of a contribution to enable
an automatic retrieval into the database of the publisher. 
Please support a fast and smooth processing of your
contribution by carefully filling in the provided fields.
These fields are described in the file "article.tex"
in this directory. It makes sense, to use this file
as main file of your contribution and fill in in the
appropriate information.

Not all fields are needed for every journal. Please 
find in the following table which fields are mandatory (m),
optional (o) or unused (u) for your contribution and do not
forget to send the author figure files

Please note the use of the \title macro. Because there
are articles with german as well as with english titles
and also such that have both, you have to provide the
language (\title[de]{...}, \title[en]{...}).

The article is compiled with the standard LaTeX class
"article". ovjour.sty only adjusts the textwidth to allow
you to break long formulas in a proper way. Please
ignore overfull text lines, bad page breaks and so on.
Please place your figures and tables at the end of your
submission (behind \end{thebibliography}), otherwise they
will not be visible in multi-column layouts. If you don't
have a bibliography, please insert "\nobibliography" at the
end of your document and place the figures afterwards.
To determine the widths of the figures the measures \colwidth,
\halfwidth and \fullwidth are provided. They allow you to scale 
your figures to one of three fixed sizes (e.g.
\includegraphics[width=\halfwidth]{fig1.eps}). 
\colwidth is the width of the text column, \fullwidth
the width of the entire text (obsolete for onecolumn
layouts), \halfwidth is a measure inbetween.

The formatting of your contribution will be done by
the publisher. Therefore it is helpful, if you only
use macros for the markup of the contents.

In the subdirectory "example" you will find an example
of a complete article.
