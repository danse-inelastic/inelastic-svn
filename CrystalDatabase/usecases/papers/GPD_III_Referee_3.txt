Reviewer 3's comment:
---------------------
The paper has a very desirable aim of obtaining a global phase diagram for molecular crystals using
a small number of reference lattices and a “modest number” of interaction potential parameters. As
such a more general discussion (sec 3) and condensed account of potential determination (sec 2)
would have been useful to the general reader. There exists a large volume of experimental crystal
structure data along with a large number of theoretical models. It is attractive to judge these models
after assessing their merits to find a classification that gives an hierarchy of their usefulness.
The authors use a small number of parameters to describe intermolecular potentials for constructing
the GPDs thereby aiming to enhance the utility of GPDs for materials design. The authors start from
a given lattice of a plastically crystalline, rotationally disordered state and examine the evolution of
the space groups of the new phases that appear as the temperature is changed for a fixed
intermolecular potential when single molecules are reduced to spheres. Such structures are
necessarily a subgroup of on of the reference lattices. The potential itself is obtained from
interaction between molecular orbitals of different molecules which are used as microscopic
director belonging to S2 with two degrees of freedom. If one associates the orbital orientation with a
spin, then this approach is concerned only with local orientational spin balance. Neither local
orientational balances of momentum and angular momentum nor entropy nor long-range alignment
tensor balances seem to be considered, as they have been done in the theory of liquid crystals.
Consequently it does not seem that there is viability in the phase diagrams that are obtained for the
various physical conditions,

    With great respect for an educated reviewer that has invested a generous amount of time to give constructive feedback on a difficult subject, it seems there may be a small misunderstanding.  The potential is not based on a "microscopic director" description with only 2 degrees of freedom (such as the Axial Next Nearest Neighbor Ising model) but, as discussed in more detail on page 4, the potential is based on a complete set of basis functions over SO3 x S2 x SO3 and so has 8 degrees of freedom.  However, since the positions of the molecules are fixed (for now) in their set of reference lattices, the S2 part of the potential has *no* degrees of freedom.  Also, the orbital orientations have no association to this part (S2), or with each other ("spin balance"), but each molecule is free to rotate in whatever way it chooses.  Thus local orientational "balances of momentum" between molecules are unrelated to each molecule's angular momentum.  According to the partition function, in fact, angular momentum for each molecule "integrates out", leaving only a temperature-dependent factor.  To better clarify the nature of the potential, we have added two appendices giving an in-depth derivation.
    We thank the reviewer for pointing out the general phenomenon of omission of entropic effects.  Many studies on crystalline packing ignore these, even though they are non-negligible in molecular crystals which frequently have melting points near room temperature.  It is for this reason that in the first Global Phase Diagrams paper (GPD I) we introduced the full model which begins from elementary principles of statistical mechanics with free energetic/entropic effects fully included.  It particularly focuses on the first set of phases forming after the initial symmetry is broken at higher temperatures.  In the second paper (GPD II) we discuss the set of reference lattices appropriate to tetrahedral molecules, and in this work (GPD III), we discuss the low-temperature phases and as such, entropic effects are mild and so are not included.  Also, unlike liquid crystals, long-range alignment tensors are not necessary to describe most molecular crystals, which generally are fairly rigid over a global topology, despite a certain amount of thermal disorder.  Thus long range order is always present and material-wide strains do not influence the equilibrium thermodynamics or the applications of molecular crystals like they do liquid crystals. 

Reviewer 3's comment:
---------------------
The effort of the authors in sec 2.2 for determining potential parameters to reproduce experimental
structures may benefit from considerations of other models, notably the ANNNI (axial Next-
Nearest-Neighbour Ising) which have rich phase diagrams including commensurate and
incommensurate phases. By choosing a molecular orientation as the Ising spin the authors may
compare their predictions with that from the ANNNI model. From the viewpoint of an emphasis as
a review article it could perhaps be mandatory to make this comparison. The additional time spent
could be worth the effort. One recognizes that the final space-group-determining step involves weak
interactions that are many time within the error limits of the usual calculations. The mock version of
the ANNNI model has the advantage that it is completely solvable when reduced to a one-
dimensional exercise. The conclusions of the present authors could be compared with those from
the ANNNI models, for example.

Response:
---------
	This is a commendable idea and we thank Reviewer 3 for bringing it up.  We were somewhat aware of the vast amount of Ising-type publications, but considered an attempt to review the field adequately would inordinately shift the focus of this work and would better be spent on the extremely important subject of the paper itself: finding a sufficient number of interaction parameters to represent real materials (especially since this work is already lengthy!).  However, we have attempted to do this briefly in the revised version of our work, mostly in the context of the ANNNI-type models Reviewer 3 has mentioned.  Additionally, although the scope of *this* work is narrow and specialized, the *next* paper presenting a general computation with the full model from the high temperature reference state would indeed benefit from a more direct comparison with the ANNNI.  The only caveats may be that molecular crystal GPD interactions are only nearest neighbor for now (justified by typical van der Waals molecule-molecule interactions--see GPD I).  Another caveat is the extra degree of freedom that comes from dealing with a complete three dimensional molecule rather than a one-dimensional spin, which makes "choosing a molecular orientation as the Ising spin" a little problematic.  However, we can probably perform a qualitative comparison.  One last issue with a direct comparison is that the two potentials are *very* different, leading to ambiguities in how to compare the typical J_1 and J_2 from ANNNI with our 15 axes parameterizing a complete quantum mechanical basis set.  This has the side effect of an extremely complex and computationally demanding solution technique in the general case discussed at length in GPD I.  Thus Reviewer 3's good intentions at pointing toward the simplicity of solving ANNNIs as an impetus to make such a comparison may not be as profitable as one would hope for given the lack of a comparable methodology, which is of course lamentable!
	

Reviewer 3's comment:
---------------------
Another point that requires mention/deliberation in the context of the focus of the general
readership of the journal is the relation between the global phase diagram of essentially 3D liquids
and that of the bulk molecular crystals especially in the context and as reflected in the local critical behavior of surfaceswith or without defectsseparating the liquid and solid phase. Some
mention of these aspects would be useful.

In my opinion, the advantages of methodology of the authors using interaction potentials obtained
from orbital orientations, has to be examined in the context of those already available in the
literature.

Response:
---------
	This is an extremely interesting point, and in initial drafts we attempted a connection with subtle kinetic effects such as surface critical behavior because they have such a large effect on polymorphism.  My colleague and coauthor elected to omit such considerations, however, judging they were too far removed from the firsthand task of identifying the basic thermodynamics.  However, one may consider, instead of
