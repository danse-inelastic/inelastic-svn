Notes on Turning Java to Webpage with Ajaxswing

Setup
-----
Download:
http://www.creamtec.com/products/ajaxswing/install/index.html
Directions:
http://www.creamtec.com/products/ajaxswing/doc/setup.html

Summary of their setup directions, for unix:
~ Download the zip file, unzip it, and cd into bin/setup. Type:
$chmod 777 setup.sh
$./setup.sh 
~ set JAVA_HOME path to the jdk (example:
$export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0)
~ in the bin directory, type:
$./startServer.sh 
It may take some time for the server to start (3 minutes?)
~ Go to http://localhost:8040/ajaxswing/ and test their demo.
(You might have to enable the right JDK. Follow their directions.)

Making Crystal Database Work
----------------------------
~ As the instructions say, cd into conf directory and copy default properties file:
$cd conf
$cp WindowsThemeDemo.properties crystaldatabase.properties
~ edit crystaldatabase.properties and change the entrypoint class to:
agent.appStartClass=cod.Main
~ copy .class files (from svn repository danse.us/inelastic/CrystalDatabase/AjaxSwing/bin/cod) into /wcapps/lib/classes/cod (make a directory called cod), and .jar files (under CrystalDatabase/deployable) into wcapps/lib
~ Stop the server and start the server (have to wait ~3 minutes):
$./stopServer.sh
$./startServer.sh
~ open a browser and go to http://localhost:8040/ajaxswing/apps/crystaldatabase

To make edits to the java code and see them work on the browser:
~ The modified java files are in the svn repository under CrystalDatabase/AjaxSwing/src/cod. Edit these and compile/run, then copy the resulting .class files into /wcapps/lib/classes/cod.
~ Stop and start the server, then go to the url mentioned above to see your changes.

Problems with AjaxSwing
-----------------------
~ MouseListener doesn't work, but ActionListener does, so replace
all MouseListener stuff with ActionListener.
~ JOptionPane.showMessageDialog does not work.
~ FileChooser for saving files refuses to work, even for the demos. 

Changes Made to Crystal Database to Work with AjaxSwing
-------------------------------------------------------
~ Modified Main.java and Search.java:
~ Made the table 100 instead of 1000.
~ Replaced MouseListeners with ActionListeners
~ Replaced KeyAdapter with method that updates query when the search button is pressed

Remaining Issues for Crystal Database
-------------------------------------
~ "Save", "Visualize with Jmol", and "Export to vnf" buttons don't work
~ How do you link to other webpages? Their instructions on making button links are confusing/don't work.
