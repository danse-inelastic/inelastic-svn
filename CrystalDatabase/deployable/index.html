<h1 style="text-align: center;">Crystallography Open Database UI</h1>


<p>The crystallography open database UI is a java application that allows users to search for crystal structures.  It is based on <a href="http://www.crystallography.net">www.crystallography.net</a>  It is available via java web start at <a href="cod.jnlp">http://fireball.phys.wvu.edu/cod/cod.jnlp</a>  It can also operate within the Computational Science &amp; Engineering Online, or CSEO, (<a href="http://www.cseo.net">www.cseo.net</a>) environment. Users simply have to enter <a href="cod.xml">http://fireball.phys.wvu.edu/cod/cod.xml</a>
in the CSEO address bar or, in its next release, select it from the
candidate list of applications. The interface of the crystallography
database consists of several textboxes, buttons, and a table as shown below.</p>

<p>This picture shows the result of a null search in which no criteria
are defined. Criteria entered into the Text, Elements, and Not boxes
will need to be separated with spaces. For Volume and all the textboxes
in the second column, the left and right textboxes correspond to
minimum and maximum values. Entering an integer in the Number box will
only return results whose formula contains that exact number of
elements. The search button takes the SQL query in the text area and
executes it. The export button will open up the selected crystal in
JMol for viewing as shown here.&nbsp;</p>

Finally, the save button allows users to download the
.cif file to their computer.
Users will also be able to export structures to alternate applications with automatic file conversion in the next release.
