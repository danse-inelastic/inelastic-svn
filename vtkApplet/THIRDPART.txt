 Description: Jython is an implementation of the high-level, dynamic, 
              object-oriented language Python written in 100% Pure Java, 
              and seamlessly integrated with the Java platform. It thus 
              allows you to run Python on any Java platform.

 License:     HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
              =======================

              JPython was created in late 1997 by Jim Hugunin. Jim was also the
              primary developer while he was at CNRI. In February 1999 Barry Warsaw
              took over as primary developer and released JPython version 1.1.
              In October 2000 Barry helped move the software to SourceForge
              where it was renamed to Jython. Jython is developed by a group
              of volunteers.

              The standard library is covered by the BeOpen / CNRI license. See the
              Lib/LICENSE file for details.

              The oro regular expresion matcher is covered by the apache license.
              See the org/apache/LICENSE file for details.

              The zxJDBC package was written by Brian Zimmer and originally licensed

 Description: JyConsole is an advanced Java console for Jython, able to manipulate
              Python and Java objects.

              JyConsole is fully written in Java and based on the Jython library and
              modules. It answers to several requirements of modern consoles, such as
              command history, completion, easy script loading and basic GUI preference
              management.

              More especially, JyConsole provides an advanced object oriented completion
              on Java and Python objects. JyConsole allows the direct manipulation of any
              objects used in the python and class paths, independently of their initial
              language (Java/Python).
 
              JyConsole can be extended as any application, but its first goal is to
              offer a simple and powerful Java/Python console fully portable. JyConsole
              can be directly used as standalone application or as a embedded
              graphical component into a Java or Jython application.

 Description: The Visualization ToolKit (VTK) is an open source, freely 
              available software system for 3D computer graphics, image 
              processing, and visualization used by thousands of researchers 
              and developers around the world. VTK consists of a C++ class 
              library, and several interpreted interface layers including 
              Tcl/Tk, Java, and Python. Professional support and products 
              for VTK are provided by Kitware, Inc. VTK supports a wide
              variety of visualization algorithms including scalar, vector, 
              tensor, texture, and volumetric methods; and advanced modeling 
              techniques such as implicit modelling, polygon reduction, mesh 
              smoothing, cutting, contouring, and Delaunay triangulation. 
              In addition, dozens of imaging algorithms have been directly 
              integrated to allow the user to mix 2D imaging / 3D graphics 
              algorithms and data. The design and implementation of the 
              library has been strongly influenced by object-oriented 
              principles. VTK has been installed and tested on nearly every 
              Unix-based platform, PCs (Windows 98/ME/NT/2000/XP), 
              and Mac OSX Jaguar or later.
