To install VisAD-in-a-Box:
1) If you've received an visad-in-a-box.tar file,
   run 'tar xvf visad-in-a-box.tar'
2) If you've received an visad-in-a-box.tar.gz file,
   run 'gzcat -c visad-in-a-box.tar | tar xvf -'
3) Move into the extracted 'visad-in-a-box'
   distribution directory and run 'install_visad'
4) Answer the few installation questions, then wait
   for everything to finish installing.
5) You can remove the 'visad-in-a-box' distribution
   directory after the installation is complete.

Note: The 'cpush' utility must be available in order
      to install on all nodes in a cluster.


To keep your visad.jar file up to date:
   Simply run 'java visad.install.UpdateJar <dir>'
   where <dir> is the directory in which you've
   installed your 'visad.jar' file.

   This will only update the local 'visad.jar' file
   if it is older than the distributed 'visad.jar'
   file.

To create a new VisAD-in-a-Box distribution:
1) Create a distribution directory (in this example,
   the distribution directory will be named
   'visad-in-a-box')
2) Copy 'visad/install/install_visad' to the
   'visad-in-a-box' directory.
3) Copy a 'visad.jar' file to the 'visad-in-a-box'
   directory.
 a) If you have a VisAD source distribution, you can
    run 'make compile' (or 'make recompile') to
    compile all the VisAD sources, then run
    'make classes' to create 'visad.jar' in the
    directory about the Makefile.
4) If you want to include Java executables, you can
   do either of the following:
 a) Copy a JDK directory tree into the
    'visad-in-a-box' directory and name it
    'jdk-<OS>-<MACH>' where <OS> is whatever is
    printed by 'uname -s' and <MACH> is whatever is
    printed by 'uname -p'.

    If you do this, the included java executable will
    be used to run the installer on machines which
    match this machine's OS and MACH.
 b) Package up a JDK directory tree in a jar file
    named 'jdk-<OS>-<MACH>.jar' (where <OS> and
    <MACH> are as in the item above.)
5) In the directory above the 'visad-in-a-box'
   directory, package everything up with
   'tar cvf visad-in-a-box.tar visad-in-a-box' (or
   whatever you've named your distribution directory.)
