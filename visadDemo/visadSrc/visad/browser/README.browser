The classes in the visad.browser package compile under
JDK 1.1 for use in web browsers.  They enable client
applets to connect to VisAD DisplayImpls running on
the same computer that served the applet.

To test and demonstrate this, we provide a sample
server in visad/examples/Test68.java, a sample client
applet in visad/browser/VisADApplet.java, and a sample
web page in socket_applet.html.

To start the server, change to the visad/examples
directory and run:

  java Test68

On the same machine, install socket_applet.html in the
htdocs directory for the machine's web server, and copy
the *.class files from visad/browser directory to the
htdocs/visad/browser directory.

On the client machine where you will run your web
browser, you must make sure that the classes in
visad/browser are not available via your CLASSPATH.
You can do this by either using a machine where VisAD
is not installed or setting CLASSPATH to blank.

If you are using Internet Explorer for web browing,
simply aim it at socket_applet.html on your server
machine.  When the applet comes up, substitute the IP
name of the server for localhost, and click on 'Connect'.

If you using Netscape for web browsing, you must first
add the following line:

  user_pref("signed.applets.codebase_principal_support", true);

to your ~/.netscape/preferences.js file.  Then aim
netscape at socket_applet.html on your server machine
and proceed as described above.
