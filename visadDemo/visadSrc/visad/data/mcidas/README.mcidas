(update 7.13.00)

The classes in this directory and in the edu.wisc.ssec.mcidas and
edu.wisc.ssec.mcidas.adde packages will support the import of data in
some of the the McIDAS (http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas) formats.  
You will find some code there to handle McIDAS GRID and MD files as
well.

Also, please look at the visad.examples package for more examples of
using the ADDE protocol for images.

Initially, the AreaAdapter class (and AreaForm) will read the McIDAS image
file format known as AREAs.  This files may contain single or
multi-banded data from any of several sources.

The AREA format allows for optional navigation and calibration
data to be included.  These data are supposed to then be used
with runtime load modules to provide for the desired
transformations.  

In the VisAD implementation, we intend to support navigation by
provided particular CoordinateSystem classes.  At this time, the
AREACoordinateSystem only supports GVAR, MSAT and MOLL navigations.  
It provides a reference coordinate system of Latitude and Longitude, 
and will transform to/from that from image pixel locations.

The McIDAS base map file format (OUTL) provides latitude and
longitude data needed to construct basemap overlays for images
and backgrounds for data plotting and contour drawing.  The
BaseMapAdapter class is provided here to allow these OUTL files
to be used.  We will probably make only a limitied number of
these files available, and instead concentrate efforts for map
drawing in the world of "shapefiles".

In order to test the classes in the visad.data.mcidas directory,
you should acquire an AREA file and probably a basemap file. I've
provided samples at:

ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/AREA0007
ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/OUTLUSAM

FTP these files (using binary mode) into the visad/data/mcidas
directory, and then run:  java TestArea 

Alternatively, you may use them directly over the Inet by:

java TestArea ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/AREA0007 1 ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/OUTLUSAM

This TestArea includes both the display of the image from
AREA0007 and the overlay of the basemap from OUTLUSAM, correctly
navigated into the GVAR coordinate system.

Please send me your questions and comments.
