
                     GoesCollaboration


1. Introduction

This is a demonstration of interactive and collaborative GOES
satellite sounding analysis using VisAD.  GoesCollaboration is
a collaborative application that runs in both 'server' and
'client' modes, as well as stand-alone.

Because of native code, the server mode of GoesCollaboration
runs only on Sparc Solaris.

These applications are based on an application developed
under VisAD 1.1 by Paolo Antonelli and Bob Aune.


2. Downloading GoesCollaboration data files

The source code for the GoesCollaboration application is
included in the main VisAD distribution in the package
visad.paoloa.  However, the applications need two data files to
run, data_obs_1.dat and goesrtcf.  Download these files from:

  ftp://www.ssec.wisc.edu/pub/visad-2.0/paoloa.files.tar.Z

Unpack the file by running:

  uncompress paoloa.files.tar.Z
  tar -xvf paoloa.files.tar


3. Building GoesCollaboration

Running GoesCollaboration requires VisAD, JDK 1.2 and Java3D.
More information about these is available at:
 
  http://java.sun.com/

and

  http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/visad.html

To build the server mode of GoesCollaboration first edit
java/paoloa/Makefile to change the path:
 
  JAVADIR=/opt/java

to point to the appopriate directory where you installed Java.
Then run 'make' in the visad/paoloa directory.

To build the client mode of GoesCollaboration it is
sufficient to run 'javac GoesCollaboration.java' in the
visad/paoloa directory.


4. Running GoesCollaboration in stand-alone mode

Before you run the GoesCollaboration application make sure that
your LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the visad/paoloa directory (for
access to native code in the shared object
libGoesCollaboration.so).  Then run the GoesCollaboration
application by typing:

  java visad.paoloa.GoesCollaboration


5. Running GoesCollaboration in Server Mode

Before you run the GoesCollaboration application in server
mode make sure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes the
visad/paoloa directory (for access to native code in the
shared object libGoesCollaboration.so).  You also need to
make sure that rmiregistry is running - it can started
simply by typing:

  rmiregistry &

Then run the GoesCollaboration application in server mode
by typing:
 
  java visad.paoloa.GoesCollaboration


6. Running GoesCollaboration in Client Mode

Before you can run GoesCollaboration in client mode, it
must already be running in server mode (on a Sparc Solaris
system with IP name ip.name.of.server).

Then run the GoesCollaboration application in client mode
by typing:

  java visad.paoloa.GoesCollaboration ip.name.of.server


7. How to Operate GoesCollaboration

The index slider retrieves a new model of a vertical
column of atmosphere and derives the vertical weighting
function of 18 spectral channel of the GOES satellite
sounder from this model and from the solar zenith angle
and skin (surface) temperature set on sliders.  The
weighting function is displayed in the upper left window.
Brightness temperature errors for this model and
weighting function are displayed in the lower right
display window.  Any motion of the "save as ref. conf.?"
slider saves a snapshot of the wieghting function, and
the upper right window displays the difference between
the current weighting function and the last saved
weighting function.

The model atmosphere column is displayed as graphs of
perssure, temperature, water vapor and ozone versus
vertical level in the lower left window.  The user can
change these vertical profile by re-drawing the graphs
for temperature, water vapor and ozone (re-draw these
graphs by clicking the right mouse button the graph you
want to re-draw and dragging the mouse).

You can rotate the displays in the upper two windows
by clicking the left mouse button and dragging.  Zoom
any of the four display windows by dragging the left
mouse button while the SHIFT key is pressed, and pan
any of the four display windows by dragging the left
mouse button while the CTRL key is pressed.

Any changes to the four sliders or to the vertical
profile trigger recomputations, much like a spread
sheet.

In the GoesCollaboration application, all users see the
same values on their sliders, the same vertical profiles,
weighting functions, weighting function differences, and
brightness temperature errors.
