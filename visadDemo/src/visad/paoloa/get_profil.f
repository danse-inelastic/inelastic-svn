c * Obtain climatological temperature, water-vapor mixing-ratio,
c       and ozone mixing-ratio profiles by interpolating in
c       month and latitude amongst the FASCODE model atmospheres.

c * Pressure coordinate is 40-level "satellite-standard" (0.1 to 1000 mb).

c   Input:
c         imon = month    (1,...,12)
c         rlat = latitude (degrees)

c   Output:
c         tpro = temperature profile (deg K)
c         wpro = water-vapor mixing ratio profile (g/kg)
c         opro = ozone mixing ratio profile (ppmv)
