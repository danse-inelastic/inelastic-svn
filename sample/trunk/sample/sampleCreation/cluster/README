To make a .bas file for a rutile cluster:

1) type
python cluster.py          or
./cluster.py               if you have the env utility installed in /bin

2) answer the questions (input what part of the rutile unit cell you'd like as the center of the cluster and the radius)

3) output is written to cluster.bas
