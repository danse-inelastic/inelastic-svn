0) S(Q,E) has units, and thus has an `absolute value'.  Experimentally, we 
     almost always determine the values of S(Q,E) only relative to some other
     value.  (As in, S(Q,E) for Nickel at 10 K as compared to S(Q,E) for 
     Nickel at 1275 K.)  Should this be annotated somewhere?  Somehow?

1) We need a unit cell file format.

2) Should the BvK system file format be stored here?  Should it be modified
     somehow first?
     
3) Maybe put all of this in a python package --Brandon
