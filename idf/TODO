0) Move UNITS into README ?

1) A possible variant on the files (Qs, for example):

  1 char[256] --> "Qs"
  1 char[1024] --> Comment.  Units are really useful comments.
  1 int32 --> version 1 
  1 int32 --> Dimension D
  1 int32 --> Number of Qs, N_q
  double[D*N_q] --> The Qs go here.

The idea about putting the unit in the comments is that 
  i)  you can allow all decisions about units and coordinates to happen at the 
      user interface for a particular application.
  ii) If (1) is true, then the point of storing units is that one user can 
      produce data and another can use it.  Since you can't force people to be 
      sane, this may be a waste of time.  Comments allow people who happen to 
      be sane to pass along useful information.
