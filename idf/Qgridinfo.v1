Unlike other idf data files, this file is a plain text file.
This file describes a regularly spaced grid in Q space.

Example:
b1 = 2.23, 0, 0
n1 = 10
b2 = 0, 2.23, 0
n2 = 10
b3 = 0, 0, 2.23
n3 = 10

The {bi} are reciprocal lattice vectors.
The {ni} are number of grid points along each direction. 
  PLEASE NOTE:
    This is not the number of steps, it is the number of vertexes. 
    So, if you have grid points from -0.5, -0.4, ..., 0.4, 0.5 along b1, you have n1 = 11.
