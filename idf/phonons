phonons on a grid is a group of data files:

 Omega2: squares of phonon angular frequencies on a grid. See "Omega2.v1" for more details
 Polarizations: phonon polarizations on a grid. see "Polarizations.v1" for more details
 Qgridinfo: Q grid parameters. see "Qgridinfo.v1" for more details
 DOS: phonon dos. see "DOS.v1" for more details
