Agreed upon binary file formats for passing data between various codes. 
The formats are given by:
   A.vX
where A is the type of file and X is the integer version number.

All units should be SI.
   distances are in meters [m]
   times are in seconds [s]
   masses are in kilograms [kg]
     etc...

The first entry in each file is a char[64] that identifies the file format.
The second entry is an integer version number.
The third entry is a char[1024] that is a comment.  The comment is by 
    definition completely irrelevant to all programs.  They are only there to 
    help humans understand what other humans were doing.

Currently, we have:
