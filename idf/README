Agreed upon binary file formats for passing data between various codes. 
Units are briefly discussed in the file UNITS.

The formats are given by:
   A.vX
where A is the type of file and X is the integer version number.

Currently, we have:

Filename      | Contents
--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
Qs.v1         | List of Q-Vectors, for BvK, Simulations, etc.
Es.v1         | List of Energies, for BvK, Simulations, etc.
Eigs.v1       | List of Eigenvalues, from BvK, etc.
Pols.v1       | List of Polarization vectors, from BvK, etc.
Sqe.v1        | List of Scattering as a function of Q and E.
