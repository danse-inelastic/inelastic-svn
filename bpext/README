This package helps developers to build interconnection codes for 
boost python bindings with other types of bindings through PyCObject.

The main usage of this package are two methods:

 - extract_ptr: extract a pointer from a boost python object and return a PyCObject 
   of that pointer.

 - wrap_ptr: extract the raw pointer inside a PyCObject and wrap it in a boost python
   object. return the boost python object.
