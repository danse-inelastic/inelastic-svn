This package helps developers to build interconnection codes for 
connecting boost python bindings to other types of bindings through PyCObject.

The main usage of this package are contained in two methods:

 - extract_ptr: extract a pointer from a boost python object and return a PyCObject 
   of that pointer.

 - wrap_ptr: extract the raw pointer inside a PyCObject and wrap it in a boost python
   object; return the boost python object.



For developers:

  To extend this package to support more c++ classes, you will need
  to register new converters. Please read module/register_converters.*
  for an example. The basic syntax is:

    extractorRegistry[type_name] = extract_ptr< type >;
    wrapperRegistry[type_name] = wrap_ptr< type >;
