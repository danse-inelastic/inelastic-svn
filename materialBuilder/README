This is the beginnings of a stripped-down version of nanorex's GPL'd nanoengineer, with all the copyright info replaced by Brandon Keith.
This is being wrapped in pyre and Brandon's supercell/crystal builder are being added as pyre facilities / DANSE BSD additions (eventually 
to be moved to a separate directory).
This will not be released publicly until Nanorex releases their official GPL version and all additions we make to this will be brought to the attention of
Nanorex so they can add it to their version since they have been generous enough to make this prerelease version available to us.
