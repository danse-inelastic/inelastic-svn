    (for a separator) or a tuple of the form (menu text, callable or submenu,
    option1, option2, ...) with 0 or more options (described below).
       A submenu can be either another menu_spec list, or a QMenu object
    (but in the latter case the menu text is ignored -- maybe it comes
    from that QMenu object somehow -- not sure if this was different in Qt3).
    In either case it is the 2nd menu-item-tuple element, in place of the callable.
       Otherwise the callable must satisfy the python 'callable' predicate,
    and is executed if the menu item is chosen, wrapped inside another function
    which handles Undo checkpointing and Undo-command-name setting.
       The options in a menu item tuple can be zero or more (in any order,
    duplicates allowed) of the following:
    'disabled' -- the menu item should be disabled;
    'checked' -- the menu item will be checked;
    None -- this option is legal but ignored (but the callable must still satisfy
    the python predicate "callable"; constants.noop might be useful for that case).
       The Qt3 version also supported tuple-options consisting of one of the words
    'iconset' and 'whatsThis' followed by an appropriate argument, but those have
    not yet been ported to Qt4 (except possibly for disabled menu items -- UNTESTED).
       Unrecognized options may or may not generate warnings, and are otherwise ignored.
    [###FIX that -- they always ought to print a warning to developers. Note that right
    now they do iff 'disabled' is one of the options and ATOM_DEBUG is set.]
       The 'widget' argument should be the Qt widget
    which is using this function to put up a menu.
       If the menu argument is provided, it should be a QMenu
    to which we'll add items; otherwise we create our own QMenu
    and add items to it.
