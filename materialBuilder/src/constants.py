Various constants used in more than one module, and a few global variables.

Names defined here should be suitable for being imported (thus "used up")
in all modules.

    # > The accepted bond length for diamond is 1.544 ("Interatomic  
    # > Distances,' The Chemical Society, London, 1958, p.M102)....

# note: these Button constants might be no longer used [bruce 070601 comment]

rightButton = 2
# in Qt/Mac, control key with left mouse button simulates right mouse button.
midButton = 4
shiftModifier = 33554432
cntlModifier = 67108864
# in Qt/Mac, this flag indicates the command key rather than the control key.

altModifier = 134217728 # in Qt/Mac, this flag indicates the Alt/Option modifier key.

# Note: it would be better if we replaced the above by the equivalent
# named constants provided by Qt. Before doing this, we have to find
# out how they correspond on each platform -- for example, I don't
# know whether Qt's named constant for the control key will have the
# same numeric value on Windows and Mac, as our own named constant
# 'cntlButton' does. So no one should replace the above numbers by
# Qt's declared names before they check this out on each platform. --
# bruce 040916


# debugModifiers should be an unusual combination of modifier keys, used
# to bring up an undocumented debug menu intended just for developers
# (if a suitable preference is set). The following value is good for
# the Mac; someone on Windows or Linux can decide what value would be
# good for those platforms, and make this conditional on the
# platform. (If that's done, note that sys.platform on Mac might not
# be what you'd guess -- it can be either "darwin" or "mac" (I think),
# depending on the python installation.)  -- bruce 040916
