selectMode.py -- Select Chunks and Select Atoms modes, also used as superclasses for some other modes

$Id: selectMode.py,v 1.194 2007/07/06 18:32:48 ninad Exp $

Some things that need cleanup in this code [bruce 060721 comment]: ####@@@@

- redundant use of glRenderMode (see comment where that is used)

- division between selectMode and selectAtomsMode

- drag algorithms for various object types and modifier keys are split over lots of methods
with lots of common but not identical code. For example, a set of atoms and jigs can be dragged
in the same way, by two different pieces of code depending on whether an atom or jig in the set
was clicked on. If this was cleaned up, so that objects clicked on would answer questions about
how to drag them, and if a drag_handler object was created to handle the drag (or the object itself
can act as one, if only it is dragged and if it knows how), the code would be clearer, some bugs
would be easier to fix, and some NFRs easier to implement. [bruce 060728 -- I'm adding drag_handlers
for use by new kinds of draggable or buttonlike things (only in selectAtoms mode and subclasses),
but not changing how old dragging code works.]

- Ninad 070216 moved selectAtomsMode and selectMolsMode out of selectMode.py

# "selection curve": the collection of line segments drawn by the cursor when defining
# the selection area.  These line segments become the selection lasso when (and if) 
# the selection rectangle disappears. When the selection rectangle is still displayed,
# the selection curve consists of those line segment that are drawn between opposite 
# corners of the selection rectangle. The line segments that define/draw the 
# rectangle itself are not part of the selection curve, however.
# Also, it is worth noting that the line segments of the selection curve are also drawn 
# just beyond the front clipping plane. The variable <selCurve_List> contains the list
# of points that draw the line segments of the selection curve.
#
# "selection area": determined by the selection curve, it is the area that defines what
# is picked (or unpicked).  The variable <selArea_List> contains the list of points that
# define the selection area used to pick/unpick objects. The points in <selArea_List> 
# lay in the plane parallel to the screen and pass through the center of the view.
#
# "selection rectangle": the rectangular selection determined by the first and last points 
# of a selection curve.  These two points define the opposite corners of the rectangle.

        # rewrite, bruce 070412, for smooth reshaping and also for general simplification:
        # [this comment and the partly redundant ones in the code will be merged later]
        # - treat general case as smooth reshaping with different (trivial) motion-function
        #   (though we'll optimize for that) -- gather the same setup data either way.
        #   That will reduce bug-differences between smooth reshaping and plain drags,
        #   and it might help with other features in the future, like handling baggage better
        #   when there are multiple selected atoms.
        # - any baggage atom B has exactly one neighbor S, and if that neighbor is selected
        #   (which is the only time we might think of B as baggage here), we want B to move
        #   with S, regardless of smooth reshaping which might otherwise move them differently.
        #   This is true even if B itself is selected. So, for baggage atoms (even if selected)
        #   make a dict which points them to other selected atoms. If we find cycles in that,
        #   those atoms must be closed for selection (ie not indirectly bonded to unselected atoms,
        #   which is what matters for smooth reshaping alg) or can be treated that way,
        #   so move those atoms into a third dict for moving atoms which are not connected to
        #   unmoving atoms. (These never participate in smooth reshaping -- they always move
        #   with the drag.)
        # - the other atoms which move with the drag are the ones we find later with N == N_max,
        #   and the other ones not bonded to unselected nonbaggage atoms, and all of them if
        #   we're not doing reshaping drag.
        # - then for all atoms which move with the drag (including some of the baggage,
        #   so rescan it to find those), we do the dragchunk optim;
        #   for the ones which move, but not with the drag, we store their motion-offset-ratio
        #   in a dict to be used during the drag (or maybe return it and let caller store it #k).
        #
        # - I think all the above can be simplified to the following:
        #   - expand selatoms to include baggage (then no need to remember which was which,
        #     since "monovalent" is good enough to mean "drag with neighbor", even for non-baggage)
        #   - point monovalent atoms in that set, whose neighbors are in it, to those neighbors
        #     (removing them from that set) (permitting cycles, which are always length 2)
        #     (during the drag, we'll move them with neighbors, then in future correct
        #      their posn for the motion of other atoms around those neighbors, as is now only done
        #      in single-atom dragging)
        #   - analyze remaining atoms in set for closeness (across bonds) to unselected atoms
        #     (permitting infinite dist == no connection to them)
        #   - then sort all the atoms into groups that move with the same offset, and find whole chunks
        #     in those groups (or at least in the group that moves precisely with the drag). (In future
        #     we'd use the whole-chunk and borrowerchunk optims (or equiv) for the slower-moving groups too.
        #     Even now, it'd be easy to use whole-chunk optim then, but only very rarely useful, so don't bother.)
        #
        # - finally, maybe done in another routine, selected movable jigs move in a way that depends on how
        #   their atoms move -- maybe their offset-ratio is the average of that of their atoms.
        
        # Ok, here we go:
