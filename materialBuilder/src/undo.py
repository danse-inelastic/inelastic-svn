undo.py

Undo-related code.

$Id: undo.py,v 1.24 2007/07/01 17:27:32 emessick Exp $

Status as of 060117:

- contains some timing test commands still cluttering up the debug menu, 

- and some real code that wraps Qt slot calls and which will probably remain in the release
for helping identify commands, make their undo checkpoints, etc.

See also undo_archive.py, undo_manager.py.

Older:

At present [050922], a lot of new undo-related code is being added here
even though some of it belongs in other modules (existing or new).
Conversely, some new undo-related code can be found in env.py, changes.py,
and perhaps HistoryWidget.py.

A result of the mess of modules might be that too much gets imported
at app-startup time (even before .atom-debug-rc gets to run).
This needs to be cleaned up, but it's probably not urgent.
