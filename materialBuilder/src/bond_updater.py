Recompute structural bond orders when necessary.

$Id: bond_updater.py,v 1.15 2007/07/01 17:27:32 emessick Exp $

This is needed for bonds between atoms whose atomtypes make p orbitals
available for bonding, to check whether pi bonds are formed,
whether they're aromatic or double or triple, to check for
radicals (pi systems containing unpaired electrons),
and to notice graphite.

(Much of that is not yet implemented for Alpha6.)

History:

bruce 050627 started this as part of supporting higher-order bonds.

    # It misses hearing about killed atoms or singlets,
    # but does hear about atoms shown only in the elt selector thumbviews!
    # I guess the latter is good, since that way it can update the bond orders in those views as well!
    # However, debug tests showed that the elt selector thumbviews need a separate redraw to show this...
    # that's ok, they're only supposed to draw single-bond atypes anyway.
    """[should be called only from env.post_event_updates]
       This should be called at the end of every user event which might affect
    the atomtypes or bond-sets of any atoms or singlets, which are passed as the
    values of the dict _changed_structure_atoms, which we should not modify
    (and which no other code will modify while we use it). (As it happens,
    the caller will clear that dict after we return.)
       This function will either update, or record as needing update, the
    structural bond orders and associated data for all
    real atoms, real bonds, and open bonds which might be in pi systems
    (or which were, but aren't anymore). [And it might do more. #k if so, #doc that here.]
       Since it must be fast, it won't do work which leads it away from the actual
    atoms it's passed, and it will leave existing bond orders alone whenever they're
    locally consistent with the current atomtypes. That is, it will only act when
    there are local inconsistencies, and it will only fix them when this can be done
    on just the atoms it was passed (or their bonds), and in a reasonably unambiguous way;
    whenever it thinks a more global update is needed, it will record this fact
    (and the affected atoms) so the user can be advised that a global bond-update is needed.
       It will assume that interpart bonds (if any) have already been broken.
