            # and the old part.topnode (that chunk) disappears from loss of atoms before we add the newly made chunk
            # containing those same atoms.
            # The only things wrong with this fix are:
            # - It's inefficient (so is the main algorithm, and it'd be easy to rewrite it to be faster, as explained below).
            # - The user ends up with a new Group even if one would theoretically not have been needed.
            #   But that's better than a traceback and disabled session, so for A7 this fix is fine.

            #   have a more general fix.
