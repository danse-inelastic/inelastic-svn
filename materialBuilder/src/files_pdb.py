files_pdb.py -- reading and writing PDB files

$Id: files_pdb.py,v 1.16 2007/06/26 04:34:01 polosims Exp $

History: this was part of fileIO.py,
until bruce 050414 started splitting that
into separate modules for each file format.

bruce 050901 used env.history in some places.

bruce 070410 added some hacks to read more pdb files successfully --
but they need review by someone who knows whether they're correct or not.
(I'll commit this to both branches, Qt3 & Qt4, since this file is presently
identical in both, so doing that should not cause a problem.)
