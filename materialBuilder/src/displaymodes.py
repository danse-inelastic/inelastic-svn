displaymodes.py -- support for new modular display modes. [Not fully implemented, as of 060608.]

$Id: displaymodes.py,v 1.3 2007/05/17 18:16:18 emessick Exp $

Initially this only handles ChunkDisplayModes, which draw entire chunks (even if they are
highlighted or selected) without drawing their atoms or bonds in the usual way. (Such a
display mode might draw the atoms and bonds in its own custom way, or not at all.)

Someday it may also handle AtomDisplayModes, which (like our original hardcoded display modes)
draw atoms and bonds in their own way, but draw chunks as not much more than their set
of atoms and bonds. These are not yet implemented.

To make a new chunk display mode, make a new file which defines and registers a subclass
of our class ChunkDisplayMode. For an example, see CylinderChunks.py.
