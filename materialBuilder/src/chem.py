chem.py -- class Atom, for single atoms, and related code

$Id: chem.py,v 1.274 2007/07/01 17:27:32 emessick Exp $


History:

- originally by Josh

- lots of changes, by various developers

- class molecule, for chunks, was moved into new file chunk.py circa 041118

- elements.py was split out of this module on 041221

- class Bond and associated code was moved into new file bonds.py by bruce 050502

- bruce optimized some things, including using 'is' and 'is not' rather than '==', '!='
  for atoms, molecules, elements, parts, assys, atomtypes in many places (not all commented individually); 050513

- bruce 050610 renamed class atom to class Atom; for now, the old name still works.
  The name should gradually be changed in all code (as of now it is not changed anywhere,
   not even in this file except for creating the class), and then the old name should be removed. ###@@@

- bruce 050610 changing how atoms are highlighted during Build mode mouseover. ###@@@ might not be done

- bruce 050901 used env.history in some places.

- bruce 050920 removing laxity in valence checking for carbomeric bonds, now that mmp file supports them.

- bruce 060308 rewriting Atom and Chunk so that atom positions are always stored in the atom
  (eliminating Atom.xyz and Chunk.curpos, adding Atom._posn, eliminating incremental update of atpos/basepos).
  Motivation is to make it simpler to rewrite high-frequency methods in Pyrex.

        usually replace it with a singlet (which is returned). Details:
           Remove bond b from self (error if b not in self.bonds).
        Note that bonds are compared with __eq__, not 'is', by 'in' and 'remove'.
        Only call this when b will be destroyed, or "recycled" (by bond.rebond);
        thus no need to invalidate the bond b itself -- caller must do whatever
        inval of bond b is needed (which is nothing, if it will be destroyed).
           Then replace bond b in self.bonds with a new bond to a new singlet,
        unless self or the old neighbor atom is a singlet, or unless make_bondpoint
        is false. Return the new singlet, or None if one was not created.
        Do all necessary invalidations of Chunks, and self._changed_structure(),
        BUT NOT OF b (see above). 
           If self is a singlet, kill it (singlets must always have one bond).
           As of 041109, this is called from atom.kill of the other atom,
        and from bond.bust, and [added by bruce 041109] from bond.rebond.
           As of 050727, newly created open bonds have same bond type as the
        removed bond.
