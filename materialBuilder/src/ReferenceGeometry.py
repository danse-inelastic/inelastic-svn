History:
ninad 20070521 : Created

ninad 20070601: Implemented DragHandler and selobj interface for the 
class Handles. (and for ReferenceGeoemtry which is a superclass of Plane)

ninad 20070604: Changed the superclass from Node to Jig based on a discussion 
with Bruce. This allows us to use code for jig selection deletion in some select 
modes. (note that it continues to use drag handler, selobj interfaces.). 
This might CHANGE in future.  After making jig a superclass of ReferenceGeometry
some methods in this file have become overdefined. This needs cleanup

ninad 20070606: Created a GeometryGeneratorBaseClass (temporary work for Alpha9, 
to be revised) . In Alpha9 this class is inherited by PlaneGenerator class 
"""

#@NOTE:This file is subjected to major changes.

#@TODO: Ninad20070604 :
#- Needs documentation and code cleanup / organization post Alpha-9.
#-After making jig a superclass of ReferenceGeometry
#some methods in this file have become overdefined. This needs cleanup.
