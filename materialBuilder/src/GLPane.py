GLPane.py -- NE1's main model view, based on Qt's OpenGL widget.

        (using the given gl_select name), and which (1) has now noticed this, via its entry in self.glselect_dict
        (which was made when GL_SELECT mode was exited; as of 050609 this is in the same paintGL call as we're in now),

        their coordinates differently (as the use of gluPickMatrix for GL_SELECT is likely to do),
