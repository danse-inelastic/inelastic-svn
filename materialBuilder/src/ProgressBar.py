        From the Qt documentation:
        "If the user presses the Escape key in a dialog, QDialog.reject() will be called. 
        This will cause the window to close, but note that no closeEvent will occur."
        
        In other words, hitting the Escape key closes the dialog and it cannot be 
        retrieved.  This is very confusing since the simulation run is still running, but
        there is no way to see progress info or abort the run.  To fix this situation,
        we simply call abort_run if QDialog.reject() is called.
