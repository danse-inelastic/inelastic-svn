Process.py

Provides class Process, a QProcess subclass which is more convenient to use,
and a convenience function run_command() for using it to run external commands.

$Id: Process.py,v 1.3 2007/05/16 23:37:50 emessick Exp $

History:

bruce 050902 made this, using Qt doc and existing QProcess calls for guidance.

Future plans:

This can be extended as needed to be able to do more flexible communication
with external processes, and have better convenience functions, e.g. for
running multiple processes concurrently.

And it might as well be extended enough to replace some existing uses of QProcess
with uses of this class, if that would simplify them (but I'm not sure whether it would).
