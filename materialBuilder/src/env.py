env.py

A place for global variables treated as "part of the environment".

$Id: env.py,v 1.31 2007/07/01 17:27:32 emessick Exp $

This module is for various global or "dynamic" variables,
which can be considered to be part of the environment of the code
that asks for them (thus the module name "env"). This is for variables
which are used by lots of code, but which would be inconvenient to pass
as arguments (since many routines would need to pass these through
without using them), and which some code might want to change dynamically
to provide a modified environment for some of the code it calls.

(Many of these variables will need to be thread-specific if we ever have threads.)

Also, certain basic routines for using/allocating some of these global variables.


Usage:

import env

   ... use env.xxx as needed ...
   # Don't say "from env import xxx" since env.xxx might be reassigned dynamically.
   # Variables that never change (and are importable when the program is starting up)
   # can be put into constants.py


Purpose and future plans:

Soon we should move some more variables here from platform, assy, and/or win.

We might also put some "dynamic variables" here, like the current Part --
this is not yet decided.

Generators used to allocate things also might belong here, whether or not
we have global dicts of allocated things. (E.g. the one for atom keys.)

One test of whether something might belong here is whether there will always be at most one
of them per process (or per active thread), even when we support multiple open files,
multiple main windows, multiple glpanes and model trees, etc.


History:

bruce 050610 made this module (since we've needed it for awhile), under the name "globals.py"
(since "global" is a Python keyword).

bruce 050627 renamed this module to "env.py", since "globals" is a Python builtin function.

bruce 050803 new features to help with graphics updates when preferences are changed

bruce 050913 converted most or all remaining uses of win.history to env.history,
and officially deprecated win.history.
