"""

# Import order issues --
# This module basic gets imported first, and it will be imported at the beginning of most modules.
# But it wants to define things of general interest to all modules.
#
# This can lead to recursive import problems. Here is how we will resolve them:
# - If a high-level def should be included here, import it last.
#   Then when it imports basic, it will find what it needs already defined in basic.
# - When we import several high-level defs, they should be lowest-level first; higher ones will find lower ones
#   defined in basic when they import it, but not vice versa (but they shouldn't need to find them).
# - When we import symbols like Expr or define symbols like Arg, also do this in order of level, in terms of import dependency.
#
# Note that this means we can't put all our import statements first --
# we have to interleave them with local defs, based on level.
#
# Specific problems:
# - ExprsMeta knows about special cases for some symbols defined in modules which have to import ExprsMeta for its metaclass.
#   Solution: ExprsMeta should only import those special-case symbols at runtime.
#   (And it should do so using reload_once, so their own modules can support runtime reload.)
#
# Approximate order of imports:
# - Python and debug utilities (especially the ones needed by ExprsMeta), including those defined outside this exprs package
# - ExprsMeta (needed as a metaclass by many classes we'll define)
# - abstract classes like Expr and InstanceOrExpr
# - widget classes, in order of lowest to highest level (most of them don't need to be imported by this module at all)

    Warning: this system does not yet properly handle indirect imports, when only the inner module has

    As a workaround, if A imports B and you edit B.py, also edit A.py in order to trigger the desired runtime reload of B.py.
    
    Note: this function's module (exprs.basic itself) is fast and harmless enough to reload that it can be
    reloaded on every use, without bothering to use reload_once. Therefore, external callers of anything
    in the exprs package can always "import basic;reload(basic)" first, and if they do, all modules within
    exprs can just start with "from basic import *". But for clarity, some of them call reload_once on basic too.

PIXELS = 0.035 ###WRONG: rough approximation; true value depends on depth (in perspective view), glpane size, and zoomfactor!
    ###e A useful temporary kluge might be to compute the correct value for the cov plane, and change this constant to match
    # whenever entering testmode (or perhaps when resizing glpane), much like drawfont2 or mymousepoints does internally.
    # But if we do that, then rather than pretending it's a constant, we should rename it and make it an appropriate function
    # or method, e.g. glpane.cov_PIXELS for the correct value at the cov, updated as needed.
    #   We might also replace some uses of PIXELS
    # with fancier functions that compute this for some model object point... but the main use of it is for 2d widget display,
    # for which a single value ought to be correct anyway. (We could even artificially set the transformation matrices so that
    # this value happened to be the correct one -- in fact, we already do that in DrawInCorner, used for most 2d widgets!
    # To fully review that I'd need to include what's done in drawfont2 or mymousepoints via TextRect, too.)
    #   For model objects (at least in perspective view), there are big issues about what this really means, or should mean --
    # e.g. if you use it in making a displist and then the model object depth changes (in perspective view), or the glpane size
    # changes, or the zoom factor changes. Similar issues arise for "billboarding" (screen-parallel alignment) and x/y-alignment
    # to pixel boundaries. Ultimately we need a variety of new Drawable-interface features for this purpose.
