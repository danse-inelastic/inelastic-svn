"""Instances of subclasses of this can be unplaced or placed (aka "instantiated");
if placed, they might be formulas (dependent on aspects of drawing-env state)
for appearance and behavior (justifying the name Drawable),
or for some value used in that (e.g. a color, vector, string).
   Specific subclasses, e.g. Rect, contain code which will be used in placed instances (mainly drawing code)
unless the env provided an overriding expansion for exprs headed by that subclass.
If it did, the instance created by placing such an expr will (usually) have some other class.
"""

class InstanceOrExpr(Expr): # see docstring for discussion of the basic kluge of using one class for both
    """Main superclass for specific kinds of Instance classes whose python instances can be either Instances or Exprs,
    and (more importantly for the user) whose use as a constructor usually constructs an Expr.
    Used (for example) for Column, Rect, If, Widget2D, etc. See elsewhere for general explanation [#nim].
       The rest of this docstring discusses some fine points of the class semantics and implementation,
    and possible changes to them.
       Kluge: the same class is used to represent both Exprs and Instances of the same type; the difference is encoded
    in self._e_is_instance, and is constant throughout one python-instance's lifetime (after it's fully constructed,
    which means, after __init__ and perhaps after immediately subsequent private methods in another Expr which created it).
    Many methods either assert a specific state for self._e_is_instance, or branch on it (or ought to #e).
       Pro: developer can create and use just one class, e.g. Rect, needing no other setup/registration except defining it,
    to both hold the Rect Instance methods, and serve as the Rect Expr constructor. The Instance methods can be written
    (after an initial assertion) as if self is the Instance (as opposed to self.instance, or some argument they receive),
    and (to avoid unpleasant surprises) that's actually true. And the class as constructor always constructs a Python instance
    of itself, as one would expect.
       Con: the Instance methods could be accidently requested in an Expr version, or vice versa; their very presence
    might mess up some semantics, since it's generally bad if expr.attr does anything except construct a getattr_Expr.
    The motivations above are not obviously good enough to justify the bug risk and internal-method unclarity.
       Possible issues in present implem: constant_Expr(10) is in some sense both an Expr *and* an Instance. The predicates
    don't yet account for this. And logic bugs in the whole scheme may yet show up.
       Possible alternative: these classes could represent only Instances, but still be usable as Expr constructors,
    by having __new__ create a separate (nim) ExprForInstanceOrExpr object which is not a subclass of this class,
    but which knows which subclass of this class to create when it needs to make Instances from itself. If this was done,
    much of the code in this specific class InstanceOrExpr would be moved to ExprForInstanceOrExpr, which might be renamed
    to be more general since it would really apply to any Expr which can be called, remaining an Expr but having its
    option formulas customized or its arg formulas supplied, and can then later be instantiated in an env to produce
    a specific Instance based on those formulas.

# Implem notes for _value [061110, written when this was in Boxed.py]:
# - Q: make it have an implicit Instance, I think -- or use a convention of adding one explicitly?
#   A: the convention, so it can work with other formulas too? no, they'd also need instantiation to work... not sure actually.###@@@
#   - BTW that might mean we get in trouble trying to pure-eval (which is what?) an Expr made from InstanceOrExpr, e.g. for a formula
#   to figure an iterator-expr to use in something else! We'll have to try that, and understand the semantics more clearly...
#   could it be that we'll have to explicitly Hold the exprs assigned to class attrs in cases like that?!?
# - where we use that _value is probably in _e_eval in InstanceOrExpr. (I still don't know if that and make_in are exactly the same.)
# - so we could do the instantiation in the place where we use it... then (later) test what happens if it's a number or so. (##e)
#   - (or what if the entire macro with its value is supposed to come up with a pure expr? test that too. ##e)
# So for now, just run the instantiation in the place we use it, in InstanceOrExpr._e_eval.
# But worry about whether InstanceOrExpr._e_make_in sometimes gets called instead by the calling code.
# Maybe better do it in whichever one has precedence when they both exist... that's _e_make_in (used in _CV__i_instance_CVdict).
# _e_eval just calls it, so that way it'll work in both. Ok, do it. ###
# WAIT, is it possible for the _value formula to vary with time, so that we want an outer instance,
# delegating to a variable inner one? (Perhaps memoizing them all sort of like GlueCodeMemoizer would do... perhaps only last one.)
# hmm... #### note that _make_in should pick up the same instance anyway, if it exists, but it looks to me like it might not!!! ###BUG
