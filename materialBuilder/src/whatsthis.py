wware 20060706:

Bruce and I have been discussing whats-this text and we realized that
it can come from two unrelated sources.

One source of whats-this text is the UI file, for instance in
MainWindowUI.ui where you see things like this:
   <property name="whatsThis">
       <string>&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Minimize Energy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;.....
       </string>
   </property>

The other source is the createWhatsThis() function in whatsthis.py,
where you see things like this:
   fileOpenText = "<u><b>Open File</b></u>    (Ctrl + O)<br> " .....
   self.fileOpenAction.setWhatsThis(fileOpenText)

Having two different sources for whatsthis text could become a source
of confusion for developers. It might make sense at some point after
A8 to find all the whats-this text specified in UI files, and move it
into whatsthis.py (or maybe in some cases other Python source files).

    """Fix whatsthis text and objects (for all OSes, not just macs as it once did).
    This should be called after all widgets (and their whatsthis text) in the UI have been created.
       It's ok, but slow (up to 0.2 seconds per call or more), to call it more than once on the main window.
    If you call it again on something else, as of 060319 this will cause bugs by clearing
    _objects_and_text_that_need_fixing_later, but that can be easily fixed when we need to support repeated calls
    on smaller widgets. Calling it on a single QAction works, but doesn't do enough to fix the text again
    for toolbuttons (and I think menuitems) made by Qt from that action (re bug 1421).
       See also refix_whatsthis_text_and_links, which can be called to restore whatsthis text
    which Qt messed up for some reason, as happens when you set tooltips or menutext
    for Undo and Redo actions (bug 1421).
       This function does two things:
    1. If the system is a Mac, this replaces all occurrences of 'Ctrl' with 'Cmd' in all the 
    whatsthis text for all QAction or QWidget objects that are children of parent.  
    2. For all systems, it replaces certain whatsthis text patterns with hyperlinks,
    and adds MyWhatsThis objects to widgets with text modified that way (or that might contain hyperlinks)
    or that are QPopupMenus.
