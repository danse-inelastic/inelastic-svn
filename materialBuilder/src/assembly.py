assembly.py -- provides class assembly, for everything stored in one file,
including one main part and zero or more clipboard items; see also part.py.

About the assembly and Part classes, and their relationship:

[###@@@ warning, 050309: docstring not reviewed recently]

Each assembly has a set of Parts, of which one is always "current"; the current part
is what is displayed in the glpane and operated on by most operations,
and (for now, as of 050222) the assy attributes selmols, selatoms, and molecules
always refer to the same-named attrs of the current Part. (In fact, many other
assy methods and attrs are either delegated to the current Part or have directly
become Part methods or been split into assy and Part methods.)

All selected objects (even atoms) must be in the current part;
the current part is changed by using the model tree to select something
in some other part. The main model is one part, and each clipboard item is another part.
It is not yet possible to form Groups of separate parts in the Clipboard,
but this might be added somehow in the future. For now, any Group in the clipboard
is necessarily a single Part (or inside one); each toplevel member of the clipboard
is exactly one separate Part.

Once several known bugs (like 371) are fixed, then bonds between parts will not be allowed
(since they would be bonds between atoms or jigs in different physical spaces),
and bonds that become "interspace bonds" (due to move or copy operations)
will be automatically broken, or will cause things to be placed into the same space
in order not to break them.

Note that all info in the assy relates either to its named file or to something
about the current mode (in the general sense of that term, not just the current assy.o.mode object);
but the assy's info relating to its named file is not all stored directly in that file --
some of it is stored in other files (such as movie files), and in the future, some of it
might be stored in files referred to from some object within one of its Parts.

==

Both Part and assembly might well be renamed. We don't yet know the best terms
with which to refer to these concepts, or even the exact ideal boundary between them in the code.

==

History: the Part/assembly distinction was introduced by bruce 050222
(though some of its functionality was anticipated by the "current selection group"
introduced earlier, just before Alpha-1). [I also rewrote this entire docstring then.]

The Part/assembly distinction is unfinished, particularly in how it relates to some modes and to movie files.

Prior history unclear; almost certainly originated by Josh.

bruce 050513-16 replaced some == with 'is' and != with 'is not', to avoid __getattr__
on __xxx__ attrs in python objects.

bruce 050913 used env.history in some places.
