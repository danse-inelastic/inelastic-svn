Simple utilities (such as command-line scripts) for miscellaneous purposes.

One way to make use of these is to make symbolic links to them 
(as they exist in some cvs checkout directory you usually have)
from some directory on your shell path.

(For example, if you have a cvs checkout of cad in /materialBuilder/Working/cad, 
and a directory of command line scripts on your shell path called ~/pybin, 
then you could do this in your shell:

  % ln -s /materialBuilder/Working/cad/src/experimental/utilities/cvs-sync ~/pybin/cvs-sync
  % rehash
)

# end
