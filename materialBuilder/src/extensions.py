extensions.py

Someday: handle all our custom extension modules.

For now:
Python interface to experimental Pyrex code -- mainly just needs to fail gracefully
if its compiled form (a Python extension) is not there, or doesn't work in a drastic way.
In future, might also make sure it's up-to-date, tell you how to remake it if not,
and handle all extensions instead of just one or just Pyrex extensions.

This can't be called pyrex_test.py since then "import pyrex_test" would be ambiguous.
We want that to import the extension module... and this file might as well evolve
to try to handle all the extensions at once, so it gets a different more general name.

This fits the idea that this module contains only rarely-edited glue code,
with the real development action in the Pyrex source code (.pyx file).

For plans and status related to our use of Pyrex, see:

  http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Integrating_Pyrex_into_the_Build_System

See README-Pyrex for the list of related files and their roles.
