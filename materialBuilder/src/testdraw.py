[for doc, see testmode.py]

### WARNING: most of the rest of this docstring is obs:

known bugs:
+ slowness of redraw, and redraw happens whenever i go on or off a highlighted thing, or on or move around on something else.
  this is much worse on my iMacG4 than my iMac G5, but not because of redraw speed,
  but because on the G4, the mouse cursor stops following the mouse during the redraw!!!
  Possible fixes: different hit test alg, C-coded redraw or hit test, use of display list or saved color/depth buffer for
  nonhighlighted stuff.
  ... i put in a display list, which fixed it, but it's not invalled enough. (it also needs inval by trackball, unlike a chunk's.)

- highlight orange is slightly wider on right than nonhighlight pink (guess: glpane translates in model space, not just depth space)

- see the exception from the selobj alive test, which happens on clicks (left or cmenu) and on highlight not covering selobj,
  described below (in class Highlightable) [fixed now?]

- DraggedOn and ReleasedOn are nim (and need renaming) [no longer true, as of very long before 061120]

- region selection - works to select atoms in a rect, but the rect for it is not being drawn  [even w/o displist optim]
  - is it a failure to delegate some method to superclass, maybe emptySpaceLeftDown?
  - is it related to the reload that happens on that leftDown? (not sure why it would be)
  solved: it was failure to call super.Draw! Tested, but fix reverted, since i wanted to test the old way again. ###@@@

- singlet-drag to bond - also works but lacks rubberband line [even w/o displist optim] [might be fixed now??]

- draw_later doesn't make thing highlightable even when i don't touch color enablement and do it not much later,
so how can I test the real thing? [relates to Invisible] [would it work better as Transparent? Probably not yet...]
[###@@@ maybe fixed now]

- TextRect:
  - size is wrong
  - origin is wrong [probably fixed]
  + if too few lines, testchars at top rather than blanklines at bottom [fixed]
  - sometimes fuzzy (should fix several of these by using pixmap/displist text, or the bitmap text in pyrex_atoms)
  - fails to notice hits, in Button... no idea why. interesting Q - does it draw into depth buffer at all?
    yes it does; also, if i slide off black rect onto text, it works fine, only if i slide onto text does it fail.
    AHA, i bet it does something funny with size/pos, which messes up rendering by draw_in_abs_coords.

==

todo:
- try a display list optim in main draw function, for keeping non-highlighted stuff in one;
might work almost as well as a color/depth buffer, for this code;
but this requires knowing when it changed. One advantage: works across rotations
(as long as we keep any billboarded stuff out of it). Note: some text rendering here
shrinks when it gets nonparallel, but that's a bug, not a form of billboarding.
- more & better-organized widget exprs.
- widget exprs that map from external state (such as that in Nodes), and let us edit it.
  - i'm suspecting that one widget expr should often be used to draw all the things that use the same formulas it was set up with,
    so it would never carry per-object state -- it would be more like code. (But right now, Highlightable does carry some.)
  - for this to work, but fit with simple compounds like Row, the widget-subexprs need to get their own sub-state;
    this (as func of main state) could either be a code-id from their instance, or a posn from their caller,
    and done at compile time (their __init__ time) or draw time -- but it needs to work when they get reloaded/remade,
    suggesting that (for these simple compound -- not for iteratives used to describe rules)
    it's mainly positional, or "positional but sorted by type" so that a few kinds of code-changes don't destroy data.
    (But with optional explicit ids per instance, so that old data *can* be destroyed if you want, or preserved more readily.
    The auto ids are really only needed for transient things like glnames and saved modelview matrices, which any highlightable needs,
    and maybe for saved display lists, inval data, etc; so maybe it doesn't matter if those change on reload.
    And for anything referring to user-editable data, you need explicit ids anyway so you can recode and not obsolete your data.)
    - likely state implem (if we ignore letting it be "externally storable"): linked dicts; any convenient pyobj-constant keys,
    or maybe string keys.
    Possible convention (not thought through): the ids usable as attrs are the ones whose chars work in a py identifier.
- more todos findable by searching for "todo", "Drawable", and (older ones) "next up", "wishlist", and (implicit ones) "kluge".

            # [btw I'd guessed y+0.5 in int() should be (y-0.5)+0.5 due to outer +0.5, but that looks worse in checkbox_pref centering;
            #  I don't know why.]
            #
            # Adding outer 0.5 to y became best after I fixed a bug of translating before glu*Project (just before this if-statement),
            # which fails inside displists since the translate effect doesn't show up in glu*Project then.
            #
            # I wonder if the x/y difference could be related to the use of CenterY around TextRect inside displists,
            # which ought to produce a similar bug if the shift is not by an exact number of pixels (which is surely the case
            #  since the caller is guessing pixelwidth as a hardcoded constant, IIRC). So the guess is that caller's pixelwidth
            # is wrong and/or CenterY shifts by an odd number of halfpixels, inside displist and not seen by this glu*Project,
            # causing a bug which this +0.5 sometimes compensates for, but not always due to pixelwidth being wrong.
            # It's not worth understanding this compared to switching over to glDrawPixels or whatever it's called. ###DO THAT SOMETIME.
