confirmation_corner.py -- helpers for modes with a confirmation corner
(or other overlay widgets).

$Id: confirmation_corner.py,v 1.16 2007/07/05 05:25:49 bsmith Exp $

Note: confirmation corners make use of two methods added to the "mode API"
(the one used by GLPane to interface to glpane.mode for mouse and drawing)
for their sake, currently [070627] defined only in basicMode: draw_overlay
and mouse_event_handler_for_event_position. These are general enough to
handle all kinds of overlays, in principle, but the current implem and
some API details may be just barely general enough for the confirmation
corner.

Those method implems assume that mode subclasses override want_confirmation_corner_type
to return the kind of confirmation corner they want at a given moment.
