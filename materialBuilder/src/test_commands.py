test_commands.py -- try out using mode classes as command classes for a command stack;
 find out the minimal needs for a command with PM (and improve them);
 prototype a command stack
 
$Id: test_commands.py,v 1.15 2007/08/08 21:25:21 polosims Exp $


How to run these test commands:

- set the debug_pref "test_commands enabled (next session)"

- quit and rerun NE1

- the debug menu's submenu "other" should contain new menu commands
defined in this file, such as ExampleCommand1.


Misc bugs [this list might be out of date]:

- when exiting ExampleCommand2E (using GBC and its own graphics), the graphics remain, because the mode remains.
  A mode calls Done when it leaves but a generator doesn't, so these leave themselves behind as the mode.
  Can they safely call Done?
  And in what method should they do it? A button click, or some exit method inside GBC?

- when exiting EC2E, the PM does disappear, so the conf corner should -- and it does, but not right away,
  so I think we're missing a gl_update. Maybe the existing PM-changing methods need to provide one for the CC
  (gl_update_confcorner or so)?
  
- PM is not removed when entering testmode [probably a special case of the above]

[status: exit code added to EC1 and works; not yet to EC2] ####
  
- [bug noticed 070725]: PM is removed, but its tab remains open, when exiting ExampleCommand1
(true both before and after conversion to use PM_Dialog instead of PropMgrBaseClass)

Cosmetic bugs:

- closing groupboxes makes them flash

- [fixed] tooltip for sponsor button appears everywhere in the PM, even in its bg (annoying) [fixed in PMBC]


TODO:

When cleaning up PropMgrBaseClass etc, note some other things Mark wants to work on soon:

- add message boxes to users of PropertyManagerMixin, in a way easily moved over to PropMgrBaseClass when they use that

- port more modes over to PropMgrBaseClass, e.g. extrudeMode

- split some PMs/modes into more than one smaller PM (especially MMKit). 
  Note: See PM_ElementSelector.py. Mark 2007-08-07.
