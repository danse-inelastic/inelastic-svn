    #    0. If groups are not allowed in the clipboard (bug 213 doesn't say,

    #  then this is only a partial fix, since if a group is one of the
    #  selected items, apply2picked will run its lambda on it directly.
    #    1. The group 'new' is now seemingly used only to hold
    #  a list; it's never made a real group (I think). So I wonder if this
    #  is now deviating from Josh's intention, since he presumably had some
    #  reason to make a group (rather than just a list).
    #    2. Is it intentional to select only the last item added to the
    #  clipboard? (This will be the topmost selected item, since (at least
    #  for now) the group members are in bottom-to-top order.)
