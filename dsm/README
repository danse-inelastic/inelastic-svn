Data stream model helps developers to build "chains" of connected computing nodes
and run them. A computing node has input/ouput sockets, and the "dsm runner"
is responsible to carry "data streams" through the "chains".

Limitation:
 1. No loops.
 2. Currently only a trivial implementation of "runner" exists. So streams
    are limited in one physical machine.
