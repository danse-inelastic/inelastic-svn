1) Introduction / Purpose

   Cassandra is a modular and advanced 3D scientific data viewer.
   Cassandra is written in Java and based on the Visualisation Tool Kit, 
   VTK. 

   Like in OpenDX, Cassandra includes a graphical visualisation pipeline 
   editor based on the DedalEgraph library.

   Data processing are performed through an extensive set of dynamical and
   independent plug-ins. An advanced Python/Jython console, JyConsole, 
   complete the system and allows the direct manipulation of all objects 
   used in the system, independently of their initial language (C++/Java/
   Python). JyConsole includes an object oriented completion. 

   Thanks to this modular approach, Cassandra is highly adaptable and
   extensible to specific and tailored data processing and should simplify 
   the learning curve of the VTK library by non-specialists. 

2) Install and use

   As Cassandra is fully written in Java, the standard binary package is 
   fully supported by any operating system that support a Java Virtual Machine
   1.4.x or 1.5.x. Therefore, you will have to download and install first 
   a JRE and the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) with the Java wrapping.
   
   Caution: A JRE 1.5.x is required to use the Cassandra package made 
           for VTK 5.x.
   
   To install a JRE:
      You can download Java Virtual Machine on the Sun Web site available 
      at this URL: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
      
   To install VTK:
      You can donwload the source code of VTK at this URL: http://www.vtk.org/
      Or you can get pre-compiled VTK version from the Cassandra project 
      download page available at this URL: 
      http://dev.artenum.com/projects/cassandra/downloadPage
      
   To configure Cassandra:
      1) If your java installation didn't set the JAVA_HOME system property, 
         edit the Cassandra launching script to make it point to your JRE.
         
         - For Windows edit: Cassandra.bat
             replace: %JAVA_HOME%\jre\bin\java
             by     : c:\Prog....\Java\jdk1.5.x\jre\bin\java
             or by  : c:\Prog....\Java\jre1.5.x\bin\java

         - For Linux edit: Cassandra.sh
             replace: $JAVA_HOME/jre/bin/java
             by     : /opt/jdk1.5.x/jre/bin/java
             or by  : /opt/jre1.5.x/bin/java
         
      2) The VTK configuration
        a) Download a binary package of VTK with the Java wrapping.
        b) Unpack it in the thirdpart directory (or somewhere else if you prefere)
        c) Edit the first line of Cassandra.sh or Cassandra.bat to make it point 
           to the library directory of VTK. (*.so or *.dll)
           => For windows (Cassandra.bat): set PATH=../thirdpart/VTK5.0_Suse10_32bits/lib:%PATH%
           => For Linux   (Cassandra.sh) : export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../thirdpart/VTK5.0_Suse10_32bits/lib
        d) Edit the cassandra.propertie file and update the last line in order to fix the path to the 
           vtk.jar file.
           => java.class.path=../thirdpart/VTK5.0_Suse10_32bits/bin/vtk.jar;...

      3) Update the python path regarding your OS
          Uncomment one of the python.path property line in the cassandra.properties 
          file regarding your OS.
