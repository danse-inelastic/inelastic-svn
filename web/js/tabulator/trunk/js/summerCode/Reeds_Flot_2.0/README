My current flot graphs are enclosed in this package.  
flot_test is merely a graph created with flot that plots points found in columns.xml.  
displayxml.html displays the contents of the XML file

there are two flot zoom documents.  
one contains the array of points from the xml inside of it already, and has zoom functionality.  
the other one does not have embedded arrays, and instead reads from the xml.  this one doesn't have zoom capabilities, and is being worked on.

flot_adjustable_ticks is designed to have customizable amounts of ticks on a graph, but at the moment also doesn't work.  the ticks may only be set at the beginning.  all .js files are either jquery or flot files that have been unedited.

flot_adjustable_ticks_embedded is similar to the previous one, but has an embedded array, seeing as the zoom funtions if the array is embedded but not if it is taken from an xml.
