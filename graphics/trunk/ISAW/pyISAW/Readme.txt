After running ISAW installer (java -jar Isaw-###-install.jar),
ARCS.jar *MUST* be placed in ISAW's "HOME" directory (as defined in ISAW.py)

ARCS.jar has .class & .java files included (also ASCII .dat files)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Be careful to match this directory when you unjar the ISAW package!
Otherwise you will have to edit the ~/IsawProps.dat file.

developed with Isaw installer version: "Isaw-141-install.jar"
