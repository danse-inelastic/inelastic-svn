Graphics is in the midst of some changes (not in any particular order):
* Creating a work-around to VTK's inability to embed in a wx panel (only works in a wx frame) by dividing it up into a multi-frame application with frames for 
property setting and plot item selection.
* Integrating matplotlib interaction within the standard API.  Currently, many calls to matplotlib happen "above" the API and should be standardized within it.
* Expansion of the API to handle some of matplotlib's new functionality.
* Dealing with neutron scattering data objects.  Examples include plotting S(Q,E), S(Q,omega), S(Q,t), etc. with correct units, etc. and easy manipulation.
* Inclusion / expansion of graphics capabilities developed in individual subgroups (reflectometry, etc.).
* Include IDL in graphics api.

Bearing this in mind, run IntegratedWindow.py to start the API Tester.
