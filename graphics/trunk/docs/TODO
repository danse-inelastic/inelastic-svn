* put vtk in its own little wx plotting window and see if that helps--try alternate embeddings to see if it improves vtk speed
* fix the scripts that test vtk capabilities and use the same ones on matplotlib
* put into histogram
* merge vtk and matplotlib
* fix Matplotlib Properties and PropertyTable so it uses the established API?
* fix vtk window size
* fix this error by chaning capstyle in line object
* put y axis limits on axes properties (maybe just switch matplotlib over to the graphics api completely before trying this)
