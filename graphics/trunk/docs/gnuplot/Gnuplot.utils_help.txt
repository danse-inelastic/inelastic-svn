NAME
    Gnuplot.utils - utils.py -- Utility functions used by Gnuplot.

FILE
    /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/Gnuplot/utils.py

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains utility functions used by Gnuplot.py which aren't
    particularly gnuplot-related.

FUNCTIONS
    float_array(m)
        Return the argument as a Numeric array of type at least 'Float32'.
        
        Leave 'Float64' unchanged, but upcast all other types to
        'Float32'.  Allow also for the possibility that the argument is a
        python native type that can be converted to a Numeric array using
        'Numeric.asarray()', but in that case don't worry about
        downcasting to single-precision float.
    
    write_array(f, set, item_sep=' ', nest_prefix='', nest_suffix='\n', nest_sep='')
        Write an array of arbitrary dimension to a file.
        
            A general recursive array writer.  The last four parameters allow
            a great deal of freedom in choosing the output format of the
            array.  The defaults for those parameters give output that is
            gnuplot-readable.  But using '(",", "{", "}", ",
        ")' would output
            an array in a format that Mathematica could read.  'item_sep'
            should not contain '%' (or if it does, it should be escaped to
            '%%') since it is put into a format string.
        
            The default 2-d file organization::
        
                set[0,0] set[0,1] ...
                set[1,0] set[1,1] ...
        
            The 3-d format::
        
                set[0,0,0] set[0,0,1] ...
                set[0,1,0] set[0,1,1] ...
        
                set[1,0,0] set[1,0,1] ...
                set[1,1,0] set[1,1,1] ...
