Help on module Gnuplot.gp in Gnuplot:

NAME
    Gnuplot.gp - gp -- a platform-independent interface to a gnuplot process.

FILE
    /usr/local/lib/python2.3/site-packages/Gnuplot/gp.py

DESCRIPTION
    This file imports a low-level, platform-independent interface to the
    gnuplot program.  Which interface is imported depends on the platform.
    There are variations of this file for Unix, the Macintosh, and for
    Windows called gp_unix.py, gp_mac.py, and gp_win32.py, respectively.
    Note that the end-user should use the more capable interface from
    __init__.py (i.e., 'import Gnuplot') rather than the low-level
    interface imported by this file.
    
    See gp_unix.py for most documentation about the facilities of the
    gp_*.py modules.

FUNCTIONS
    double_quote_string(s)
        Return string s quoted and surrounded by double-quotes for gnuplot.

DATA
    __cvs_version__ = '$Revision: 2.14 $'
